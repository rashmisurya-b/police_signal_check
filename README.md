## Data Cleaning
First, I imported pandas and numpy for cleaning the data.
I read the data file, deleted the unwanted columns, removed empty columns, filled missing values, removed empty rows, and deleted duplicate records.

## Database Design
Second, I imported MySQL, sqlalchemy and  pymysql for data analysis.
I created a database connection, wrote all my queries in the MySQL database, and then fetched the query results into my Python file.

## Dashboard
Finally, I used Streamlit to fetch and display all the important details.
The data and query results are shown as tables along with insights and charts in the Streamlit app.
